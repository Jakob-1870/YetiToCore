You can restore your wallet on a live USB OS such as xubuntu. You should not install the OS. When you turn it off all data will be wiped. The wallet will not be updated.

To restore your offline wallet, return to the file manager where you opened this file, right click the empty space, select Open in Terminal. Then paste this command in the terminal: 

bash RestoreOfflineWallet.sh
